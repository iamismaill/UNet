As a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and conducting research on Deep Learning for Satellite Image Analysis under the guidance of Professor [Ha-Myung Park](http://hmpark.me ) in [DMLab](https://kmudmlab.github.io/people) , I have delved into the field of U-Net models and their application in image segmentation , I will also share my findings on the application of auto-encoders . 

In order to share my research findings with others, I have compiled a list of papers that I have studied which are related to U-Net and its variants. U-Net is a powerful deep learning architecture that has been a major breakthrough in the field of medical image segmentation since its introduction in 2015. Since then, many researchers have expanded upon the U-Net model to improve its semantic segmentation performance.

In my compilation, I have included papers that showcase my own U-Net implementations, as well as references to other relevant research in the field of semantic segmentation.
