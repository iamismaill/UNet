As a Master's student in Computer Science with a research focus on Deep Learning for Satellite image analysis, I have delved into the field of U-Net models and their application in image segmentation. 

In order to share my research findings with others, I have compiled a list of papers that I have studied which are related to U-Net and its variants. U-Net is a powerful deep learning architecture that has been a major breakthrough in the field of medical image segmentation since its introduction in 2015. Since then, many researchers have expanded upon the U-Net model to improve its semantic segmentation performance.

In my compilation, I have included papers that showcase my own U-Net implementations, as well as references to other relevant research in the field of semantic segmentation.

## 2015

 * U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation (MICCAI)  


## 2021

 * A U-Net Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation Based on Improved Skip Connections [[paper]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9724086))]
