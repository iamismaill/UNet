## Key Points
* This paper proposes a combination of convolutional neural network and auto-encoder (CAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection of industrial gas turbines.

* They  proposed an unsupervised CAE model to identify the abnormal patterns of the gas turbine operation data , The proposed model achieves the highest performance in collected data compared to conventional machine learning models.

* In Performance evaluation , The paper outlines that there is no way to measure the performance of unsupervised learning models since there are no labels available to copare the ground truth and predictions , In this regard they used abnormal signals, They appied mean squared error(MSE) and F-1 Score.

* MSE: MSE calculates the average squared difference between the vectors of predicted values and the correct values Y
